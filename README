# MLSpec: Machine Learning for QuickSpec #

This project implements a Theory Exploration system, built on QuickSpec and
"Machine Learning for Haskell" (ML4HS).

QuickSpec takes a (small) collection of Haskell definitions and builds equations
relating them (tested using QuickCheck).

ML4HS takes a (large) collection of Haskell definitions and clusters them based
on some similarity measure.

MLSpec runs QuickSpec on the output of ML4HS, as a divide and conquer approach
to scalability.
