Subject: Include CoArbitrary instances
Message-Id: <ef7884bfad113126-0-artemis@nixos>
resolution: fixed

We can only get Arbitrary functions if we have a CoArbitrary instances
for their arguments. We need to add a `mkIfCxt.... ''CoArbitrary` line
to ensure this will be picked up by the instance resolution of ifCxt.
